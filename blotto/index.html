		<h3>Basic Rules of Blotto:</h3>
		The basic game of Blotto concerns two armies distributing soldiers between some number of fields, which are each worth some number of points. By sending more soldiers to a field than your opponent, you win the points on that field. <br /> <br />
		
		<b> Example Game: </b> <br /> <br />
		
		Each army gets 10 soldiers to distribute between 3 fields. Each field is worth 1 point. <br /> <br />
		
		Amy sends [8, 2, 0], i.e. 8 soldiers to the field 1, 2 soldiers to field 2, and none to field 3. <br />
		Bob sends [4, 3, 3]. <br />
		
		Amy wins field 1, as she sent more soldiers than B. Bob wins fields 2 and 3. So, Amy scores 1 point and Bob scores 2 points. <br /> <br /> <br />
		
		Each round has different rules with various constraints. Some examples of variations on the basic game include variable numbers of soldiers, fields worth different amounts of points, and scoring dependent on number of soldiers sent to a field. <br />
		
		<h3>Tournament Rules:</h3>
		The tournament will consist of 5 rounds, each in round-robin style. <br /> Your score for a round is the average score you have against the other entries. <br /> The winner of a round is the entry with the highest average score. <br /> The winner of the tournament is the person with the highest total "performance" over their best 4 rounds. <br /> Performance in a round is defined as percentage of the average score of the winner.<br /> <br />
		Unless otherwise specified, one entry per person. <br /> Collusion is not allowed. <br /> Please do not discuss strategy or submitted entries around people who plan on submitting but have yet to do so. <br /> Entries that are deemed to be trolls will be removed and made ineligible for prizes. <br />
		
		<h3>Prizes:</h3>
		The winner of each round receives the choice of lunch on me (e.g. at Qdoba, stud, etc.), a reasonable 6-pack (if eligible), or a $10 contribution to BF. <br /> The winner of the overall tournament receives $50 through Venmo, cash or gift card. <br /> <b>All prizes are doubled for pledges</b>. Ties will be resolved at my discretion.<br />
		
		<h3>Eligibility:</h3>
		All PKS members, including alums, are eligible. <br /> PKS members are welcome to invite friends, roommates, siblings, etc. to join as well. <br />
