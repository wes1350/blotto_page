			  <h3>General Blotto Rules:</h3>
			  <ul>
			  	<li>Tournament structure is round-robin. Your entry will play every other entry once.</li>
				<li>Your score for a round is your average score against the rest of the entries.</li>
				<li>Win a field by having more soldiers on that field than your opponent.</li>
				<li>You may submit multiple entries, but only your last one will count (make sure the names match).</li>
			  </ul>
			  	
			  <h3>Submission Rules (red = requirement not satisfied):</h3>
			  <ul id = "rules">
				  <li id = "soldierCount" style = "color:red;">5 fields, UP TO 100 soldiers total (any number of soldiers from 0 to 100 is valid)</li>
				  <li id = "fieldValidity" style = "color:red;">Field entries must be nonnegative integers</li>
			  </ul>
			  
			  <h3>Round Scoring:</h3>	  
			  <ul>
			  	<li>Fields 1 - 5 are worth 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 points, respectively</li>
				<li>Ties on a field award 1/2 of that field's value</li>
				<li>First 50 soldiers are free</li>
				<li>Next 25 soldiers cost 1/2 point each</li>
				<li>Next 25 soldiers cost 1 point each</li>
				<li><b>NOTE: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE ALL 100 SOLDIERS</b></li>
			  </ul>
			  
			  <h3>Scoring Example:</h3>
			  Ripka submits [30, 30, 20, 20, 0]. <br />
			  Willie submits [10, 10, 0, 20, 30]. <br />
			  
			  Ripka wins fields 1, 2, and 3, as he sent more soldiers to each than Willie. This earns Ripka 20 + 25 + 30 = 75 points. <br />
			  Ripka and Willie tie on field 4, as they both sent 20 soldiers. They earn 1/2 * 35 = 17.5 points each. <br />
			  Willie wins field 5, as he sent more soldiers than Ripka. He earns 40 points for this. <br />
			  However, since Ripka sent 100 soldiers, he pays 0.5 * 25 + 1 * 25 = 37.5 points as penalty. <br />
			  Willie sent 70 soldiers, so he pays 0.5 * 20 = 10 points as penalty. <br />
			  In total, Ripka scores 75 + 17.5 - 37.5 = 55 points, and Willie scores 17.5 + 40 - 10 = 47.5 points.
