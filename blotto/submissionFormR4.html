			  <h3>General Blotto Rules:</h3>
			  <ul>
			  	<li>Tournament structure is round-robin. Your entry will play every other entry once.</li>
				<li>Your score for a round is your average score against the rest of the entries.</li>
				<li>Win a field by having more soldiers on that field than your opponent.</li>
				<li>You may submit multiple entries, but only your last one will count (make sure the names match).</li>
			  </ul>
			  	
			  <h3>Submission Rules (red = requirement not satisfied):</h3>
			  <ul id = "rules">
				  <li id = "soldierCount" style = "color:red;">6 fields, exactly 100 soldiers</li>
				  <li id = "fieldValidity" style = "color:red;">Field entries must be nonnegative integers</li>
			  </ul>
			  
			  <h3>Round Scoring:</h3>	  
			  <ul>
			  	<li>Fields 1-6 are worth 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, respectively</li>
				<li>Tying on a field awards half the points to each player</li>
				<li><b>Soldiers "defect" when outnumbered heavily!</b> The fields are evaluated in order, left to right. If your opponent sends at least 2x as many soldiers to a field than you, they win that field and 1/2 (rounded down) of the soldiers you sent there defect to your opponent, adding to their soldier count on the next field. Does not apply to field 6.</li>
