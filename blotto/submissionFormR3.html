			  <h3>General Blotto Rules:</h3>
			  <ul>
			  	<li>Tournament structure is round-robin. Your entry will play every other entry once.</li>
				<li>Your score for a round is your average score against the rest of the entries.</li>
				<li>Win a field by having more soldiers on that field than your opponent.</li>
				<li>You may submit multiple entries, but only your last one will count (make sure the names match).</li>
			  </ul>
			  	
			  <h3>Submission Rules (red = requirement not satisfied):</h3>
			  <ul id = "rules">
				  <li id = "soldierCount" style = "color:red;">10 fields, exactly 100 soldiers</li>
				  <li id = "fieldValidity" style = "color:red;">Field entries must be nonnegative integers</li>
				  <li id = "fieldOrder" style = "color:red;">Entries must be nonincreasing from fields 1-10 (e.g. 40, 25, 15, 7, 4, 4, 3, 2, 0, 0)</li>
			  </ul>
			  
			  <h3>Round Scoring:</h3>	  
			  <ul>
			  	<li>Each field is worth 3 points</li>
				<li>Tying on a field awards half the points (3/2) to each player</li>
				<li>Sending 0 soldiers to a field awards 0 points, even in ties, but costs 0 points</li>
				<li><b>Sending 1 or more soldiers to a field costs 1 point</b>, but makes you eligible for earning points on that field</li>
			  </ul>
			  
			  <h3>Scoring Example:</h3>
			  Ripka submits [20, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 0]. <br />
			  Willie submits [60, 30, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. <br />
			  
			  Willie wins fields 1 and 2, as he sent more soldiers to each. This earns him 6 points. <br />
			  Ripka and Willie tie on field 3, so they both earn 1.5 points for this. <br />
			  Ripka wins fields 4-9 amd earns 18 points as a result. <br />
			  Ripka and Willie, as they both sent 0 soldiers to field 10, both earn 0 points for field 10. <br />
			  Since Ripka sent soldiers to 9 fields, he pays 9 points in penalty. Similarly, Willie pays 3 points in penalty. <br />
			  In total, Ripka's score is 1.5 + 18 - 9 = 10.5, and Willie's score is 6 + 1.5 - 3 = 4.5.
