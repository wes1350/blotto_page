			  <h3>General Blotto Rules:</h3>
			  <ul>
			  	<li>Tournament structure is round-robin. Your entry will play every other entry once.</li>
				<li>Your score for a round is your average score against the rest of the entries.</li>
				<li>Win a field by having more soldiers on that field than your opponent.</li>
				<li>You may submit multiple entries, but only your last one will count (make sure the names match).</li>
			  </ul>
			  	
			  <h3>Submission Rules (red = requirement not satisfied):</h3>
			  <ul id = "rules">
				  <li id = "soldierCount" style = "color:red;">7 fields, exactly 100 soldiers</li>
				  <li id = "fieldValidity" style = "color:red;">Field entries must be nonnegative integers</li>
				  <li id = "fieldOrder" style = "color:red;">Entries must be nonincreasing from fields 1-7 (e.g. 40, 25, 25, 7, 2, 1, 0)</li>
			  </ul>
			  
			  <h3>Round Scoring:</h3>	  
			  <ul>
			  	<li>Each field is worth 1 point</li>
				<li>Ties on a field award 1/2 point</li>
				<li><b>Your score for a match is the square of the number of points you earn (e.g. 3 wins, 2 ties = 4 points = 16 score)</b></li>
			  </ul>
			  
			  <h3>Scoring Example:</h3>
			  Ripka submits [20, 20, 20, 20, 10, 10, 0]. <br />
			  Willie submits [60, 25, 15, 0, 0, 0, 0]. <br />
			  
			  Willie wins fields 1 and 2, as he sent more soldiers to each. This earns him 2 points. <br />
			  Ripka wins fields 3 to 6, as he sent more soldiers to each. He earns 4 points for this. <br />
			  Willie and Ripka tie on field 7, so they both earn 0.5 points for this. <br />
			  In total, Ripka earns 4.5 points while Willie earns 2.5. <br />
			  As a result, Ripka's score is (4.5)^2 = 20.25, and Willie's score is (2.5)^2 = 6.25.
