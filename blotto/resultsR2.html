	  <h3>Round Rules (red = requirement not satisfied):</h3>
	  <ul id = "rules">
		  <li id = "soldierCount" style = "color:red;">7 fields, exactly 100 soldiers</li>
		  <li id = "fieldValidity" style = "color:red;">Field entries must be nonnegative integers</li>
		  <li id = "fieldOrder" style = "color:red;">Entries must be nonincreasing from fields 1-7 (e.g. 40, 25, 25, 7, 2, 1, 0)</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <h3>Round Scoring:</h3>	  
	  <ul>
	  	<li>Each field is worth 1 point</li>
		<li>Ties on a field award 1/2 point</li>
		<li><b>Your score for a match is the square of the number of points you earn (e.g. 3 wins, 2 ties = 4 points = 16 score)</b></li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <h3>Scoring Example:</h3>
	  Ripka submits [30, 30, 25, 15, 0]. <br />
	  Willie submits [60, 25, 15, 0, 0]. <br />
	  
	  Willie wins field 1, as he sent more soldiers. This earns him 1 point. <br />
	  Ripka wins fields 2 to 4, as he sent more soldiers to each. He earns 3 points for this. <br />
	  Willie and Ripka tie on field 5, so they both earn 0.5 points for this. <br />
	  In total, Ripka earns 3.5 points while Willie earns 1.5. <br />
	  As a result, Ripka's score is (3.5)^2 = 12.25, and Willie's score is (1.5)^2 = 2.25.
